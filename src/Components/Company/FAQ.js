                            <p>A White-label payment gateway is a feature that allows a company to provide payment processing services under its own name, while the actual processing is done by some external third-party processor, payment gateway provider, or vendor. </p>
                            <p>In a sense, the company puts its own “label” on top of the “white label” or “blank label” that the actual payment processing solution bears. That is where the name comes from.
                            </p>
                            <p>Labeling or branding of payment gateway solutions can be done on several conceptual levels (merchant, reseller, PSP). </p>
                            <p>White-label payment gateway solutions allow companies to improve their image and reputation in the eyes of their customers (including not only cardholders, but merchants and PSPs as well).</p>
